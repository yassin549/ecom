# ðŸ”§ Fix Prisma Deployment Error

## What I Fixed:

Updated `prisma/schema.prisma` to include the Linux binary target needed for Vercel:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
  binaryTargets = ["native", "rhel-openssl-3.0.x"]
}
```

## ðŸš€ Deploy the Fix:

### Option 1: Direct Deploy (Easiest)

Just run this command:

```bash
vercel --prod
```

Vercel will automatically:
1. Install dependencies
2. Generate Prisma client with correct binaries
3. Build your app
4. Deploy it

### Option 2: If Using Git

If you pushed to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Prisma binary targets for Vercel"
git push
```

Then Vercel will auto-deploy.

## âœ… After Deployment:

Your site should work perfectly! The error was because Prisma wasn't including the Linux binary needed for Vercel's serverless functions.

**The fix ensures both binaries are generated:**
- `native` - For your local Windows development
- `rhel-openssl-3.0.x` - For Vercel's Linux servers

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Deploy Now:

```bash
vercel --prod
```

Wait 2-3 minutes for the build, then your site will be live and working!
