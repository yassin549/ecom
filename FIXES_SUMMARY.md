# E-Commerce Website Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the fixes and improvements made to the e-commerce website.

## 1. Admin Dashboard - Products & Customers Section Fix ✅

### Problem
- Admin products page was showing mock data instead of real database data
- No GET endpoint existed for fetching products
- Admin customers page was missing the users API endpoint

### Solution
- **Added GET endpoint**: `app/api/admin/products/route.ts`
  - Fetches all products from database with category relations
  - Includes admin role verification
  - Returns products ordered by creation date

- **Updated products page**: `app/admin/products/page.tsx`
  - Replaced mock data with real API calls
  - Added loading states
  - Updated type definitions to match database schema
  - Changed status field from "active/draft" to "featured" boolean
  - Added error handling with toast notifications

- **Added users endpoint**: `app/api/admin/users/route.ts`
  - Fetches all users with order statistics
  - Calculates ordersCount, totalSpent, and lastOrderDate
  - Includes admin role verification
  - Returns users with aggregated data for customers page

## 2. User Session System Enhancement ✅

### Problem
- Basic authentication without proper user isolation
- No role-based access control
- Sessions not properly managed

### Solution
- **Enhanced auth.config.ts**:
  - Added proper TypeScript type declarations for NextAuth
  - Implemented database user lookup via Prisma
  - Added JWT token with user ID and role
  - Enhanced session callback to include user ID and role
  - Implemented role-based authorization (admin vs user)
  - Added proper session isolation per user

### Key Features
- Each user has their own isolated session
- JWT-based authentication ensures stateless sessions
- Role-based access control for admin routes
- User data properly scoped to authenticated user

## 3. Mobile Navigation Bar Fix ✅

### Problem
- Navigation buttons overflowing on mobile devices
- Z-index issues causing overlap

### Solution
- **Updated header.tsx**:
  - Increased z-index from 40 to 50 for proper stacking
  - Reduced button sizes on mobile (9x9 instead of 10x10)
  - Reduced icon sizes on mobile (h-4 w-4 instead of h-5 w-5)
  - Adjusted spacing between buttons (space-x-2 on mobile, space-x-4 on desktop)
  - Reduced padding on mobile (px-4 instead of px-6)
  - Made menu button icons smaller on mobile (h-5 w-5 instead of h-6 w-6)

### Result
- Better mobile UX with no button overflow
- Proper visual hierarchy
- Responsive design that works on all screen sizes

## 4. Commands Section Implementation ✅

### Problem
- No commands functionality existed
- User mentioned finding commands in profile but they weren't implemented

### Solution

#### Database Schema
- **Added Command model** to `prisma/schema.prisma`:
  ```prisma
  model Command {
    id          String   @id @default(cuid())
    userId      String
    name        String
    description String?
    action      String   // Type: reorder, track, support, etc.
    status      String   @default("pending") // pending, completed, cancelled
    metadata    String   @default("{}") // JSON for additional data
    createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
    updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt
  }
  ```

#### API Endpoints
- **Created** `app/api/commands/route.ts`:
  - GET: Fetch user's commands
  - POST: Create new command
  - PATCH: Update command status
  - All endpoints include authentication checks
  - Commands are scoped to authenticated user

#### Profile Page Enhancement
- **Updated** `app/profile/page.tsx`:
  - Added "Actions" tab alongside Orders and Info tabs

  - Features section with 6 key benefits (icons + descriptions)
  - Mission statement section with gradient background
  - Call-to-action section linking to shop
